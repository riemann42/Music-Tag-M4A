Music::Tag::M4A version 0.26
============================

Music::Tag::M4A is a plugin module for M4A files to gather information
about music files from M4A headers.

Note:  As of version 0.28, Music-Tag is distributed as seperate packages.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   MP4::Info
   Audio::M4P::QuickTime

NOTE

Write support is dangerous for M4A files.  It will work fine with Music::Tag and other
applications, but will not work with iTunes.  If you use iTunes (and if you are using
quicktime containers for aac files, you likely are...), then don't change the tags.

TEST FILES

Are based on the sample file for Audio::M4P.  For testing only.
